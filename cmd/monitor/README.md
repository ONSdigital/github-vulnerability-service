# Vulnerability monitor

Queries the `graphql` endpoint of the github API to glean information about
open vulnerabilities on repositories belonging to a user or team.

## Setup

Supports the following env vars

| ENV          | Required | Description                                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| TOKEN        | Github access token for authenticating to the graph API    |
| GITHUB_ORG   | Name of the github organisation to which your team belongs |
| GITHUB_TEAM  | The slug (name or id) of your team                         |
| GITHUB_USER  | Username of the user of which to monitor repos             |

`TOKEN` is always required

If you wish to check repositories for an organisation team then `GITHUB_ORG` and `GITHUB_TEAM` must be set. Otherwise `GITHUB_USER` must be set instead.
